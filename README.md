# 360_Project
Script for our game draft. 

NOTE - Game Project in Unity will vary from dev to dev. 
Just do whatever works

How to setup dev environment:

Install git for windows - https://gitforwindows.org/

after install, open cmd
run (substituting your information):
git config --global user.email 'username@email.com"
git config --global user.name 'My Name'
close cmd


After modifying a file (or multiple)

go to the source control page
click the three dots, then pull. This forcefully pulls down any changes made by others currently on github
click the plus button next to any changes you want to commit (or do all)
enter a commit message (like: "add home page" or "fix login bug", don't use past tense)
press the check mark to commit (this commits your changes locally to git, you will still need to push these up to github for others to see them)
press the sync button
If this is your first commit/push:
a github sign in box appears
sign in using your browser
after signing in, close the browser
click yes on the pop up in the corner "would you like code to periodically run git fetch"
